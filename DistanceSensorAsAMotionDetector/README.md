# Using a Distance Sensor As a Motion Detector
## Background
I recently wanted to automate turning on the kitchen lights when I entered the area. 
But when I went to buy motion detectors, I found several issues with many of the models.
* Many were Alexa, Siri, Google Home Assistant compatible. To me, having to audibly say, "Hey Google" or "Hey Siri" is not
automation. I shouldn't have to do anything except be enter the area for the lights to turn on.
Besides, my mind is often wondering around aimlessly so having to think about and executing a voice a command
would severely disrupt whatever tangent I'm on while entering the kitchen.
* The units are only accessible by their app. 
	* I don't want or need a dozen different apps for home automation. 
I'm already using Ignition Maker, which comes with a web/mobile browser module to build your own app. 
	* A device that is only accessible through their own app means I'm subject to Internet outages.
	If I experience an Internet outage, my home automation should still work.
